# Kosmos
Kosmos (named after the Greek word for 'world') is a Java API for accessing Minecraft Bedrock (MCPE) worlds.
It can be used to automate world changes/exporting, or to do high-scale world changes that default Minecraft commands do not support.
The current version is operational, but Kosmos is still being worked on. Pull Requests are highly appreciated!

# Licensing & Credits
Kosmos was developed by MeItsLars, while working for the Minecraft Marketplace team 'Team Workbench'.
Team Workbench and I have decided that this project may be used by anyone under the Apache License 2.0.
This means that you are allowed to use this project commercially for free, but you can't claim you made it.
Another important point is that I am not responsible for the effect of this code when you use it.

Kosmos accesses the LevelDB through a modified wrapper library, made by Dain and Tinfoiled.
For more information on the LevelDB library used, look at https://github.com/MeItsLars/LevelDB-MCPE

# Contribution
As mentioned, you're free to use this program. However, if you made something useful, or you changed the code to be better or faster, 
I'd highly appreciate it if you contributed it back! This way, Kosmos can grow in functionality, and everyone can profit! That's the idea behind this project :)

If you want to contribute, you can create a pull request. If you have questions, feel free to contact me on Discord (MeItsLars#0183). I probably won't respond to friend requests, but I'm in the Bedrock OSS, Discord Den, and Team Workbench public Discord, so you can message me via there!

# Usage
Will be added shortly
