# Kosmos
Kosmos (named after the Greek word for 'world') is a Java API for accessing Minecraft Bedrock (MCPE) worlds.
It can be used to automate world changes/exporting, or to do high-scale world changes that default Minecraft commands do not support.
The current version is operational, but Kosmos is still being worked on. Pull Requests are highly appreciated!

# Licensing & Credits
Kosmos was developed by MeItsLars, while working for the Minecraft Marketplace team 'Team Workbench'.
Team Workbench and I have decided that this project may be used by anyone under the Apache License 2.0.
This means that you are allowed to use this project commercially for free, but you can't claim you made it.
Another important point is that I am not responsible for the effect of this code when you use it.

Kosmos accesses the LevelDB through a modified wrapper library, made by Dain and Tinfoiled.
